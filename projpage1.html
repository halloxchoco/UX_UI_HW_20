      <h4 id="userResearch">user research</h4>
      <p>Our group first conducted a small poll through Twitter to help us determine what mobile app solution would be most benneficial to our potential users. Then each of us did 2-3 user interviews through Zoom to discover our users' pain points when it came to doing Laundry. Initially our proto-persona was Isabella Stanwyck, a 31 year-old millenial influencer who needed a solution to make taking care of her clothing easier, as it was part of her job. After our research though we decided to change our persona to target who the majority of our interview subjects were. Thus we created Arielle Damiano, an early-forties successful working professional and busy mother of two kids who needed a way to make laundry more efficient since she is often busy and running out of time.</p>
      <p>After research we synthesized our data into an affinity diagram and then further into an empathy map to really get into what Arielle needed from our potential app. </p>
      <p>Here's the User Persona we created based on ourr esearch:</p><img src="images/PBP (6).jpg" alt="User Persona Arielle Damiano">
      <h4 id="ideationPhase">ideation</h4>
      <p>That lead us into our brainstorming, where we used an I Like I Want I Wish method to generate potential features.</p>
      <img src="images/PBP - Frame 19.jpg" alt="Brainstorming" id="ideationHero">
      <p>We decided to focus on 3 main features for our app: the tag scanner that was our initial idea, plus a way to save washing instructions in a "My Wardrobe feature" and a library of user-submitted laundry tips and tricks to encourage Arielle to keep returning to our app.</p>
      <h4 id="prototypingPhase">prototyping</h4>
      <p>After understanding what Arielle needed from our app we moved on to creating a user flow to define the structure of our app. Then each member of our team then went into paper prototyping, we each created our own wireframes and then combined them together. The paper prototypes formed a "rough draft" for what would become or initial, low-fidelity wireframe, which helped us during the user testing phase.</p>

      <img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-04-09 at 11.34.38 AM.png" alt="Zoom Testing" id="testingHero">
      <p>We conducted 8 tests, a combination of Zoom and in-person tests. This testing was extremely valuable as it showed us we were on the right track with our design (multiple comments on how useful testers found the app) but there were minor tweaks we could adjust to make the user flow as easy as possible. After testing we iterated on our prototype, re-arranging some of the pages and adding additional ones as needed. We also had enough time to go into a mid-fidelity prototype, implementing UI design as well to provide an easy-to-use, clean experience for Arielle.</p>
      <h4 id="endConclusion">conclusion</h4>
      <p>This process was a great experience of going through the entire user-centered design process. I learned a lot on how to develop solutions that are user-focused, and I found the research process especially enlightening. There were several instances where my assumptions were either proven wrong or validated by our user research, and that really encouraged me to continue through the design process. I also found it really rewarding to be going through the process with a team, I enjoyed being able to bounce ideas off of my teammates, and learning from their processes really improved my own design skills. If given the opportunity I would love to go further with this prototype concept, potentially developing it into a real app. There's a great potential here and an untapped market. Our group also discussed the potential for partnering with a washing machine manufacturer, to provide smart device integration with our app.</p>
